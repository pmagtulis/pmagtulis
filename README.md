- 👋 Hi, I’m Prinz Magtulis
- 👀 I’m a financial and data journalist/policy researcher currently taking up my master of science degree
in data journalism at Columbia University in New York.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming, particularly Python and have this unexplainable fascination with pandas, while trying to love BeautifulSoup.
- 💞️ I’m interested on anything about the economy, politics and business. Used to do boxing during free time (prior to pandemic),
loves to travel, binges on Netflix and a trying-hard, trying-to-fit-in and wannabe coder (hey, hopefully I succeed!)

- 📫 Learn more about me and my career through my social media accounts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/prinzmagtulis) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prinzmagtulis/), my journalism [here](https://www.philstar.com/authors/1097494/prinz-magtulis) and [here](https://www.ft.com/search?q=prinz+magtulis) and my research on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Prinz-Magtulis).
