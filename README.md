<h1> Hi there 👋 </h1>
<br>

👀 I’m a data and graphics journalist at Reuters in New York, where I specialize in visualizing financial news. I hold a masters of science degree in data journalism from Columbia Journalism School and a masters in public administration from Catholic University of Korea.

💞️ Fascinated by anything about the economy, business and finance. My decade-long journalistic work spans both text and graphics stories that help expound and explain the workings of finance and economy to the common reader. Outside journalism, I am a published author of scholarly articles and book chapters about topics on Philippine economy.
