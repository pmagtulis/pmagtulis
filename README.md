<h1> Hi there 👋 </h1>
<br>

👀 I’m a financial and data journalist as well as a policy researcher currently pursuing my master of science degree in data journalism at Columbia University in New York.

💞️ Fascinated by anything about the economy, politics and business-- essentially anything with data that can be analyzed, processed and make sense of.
