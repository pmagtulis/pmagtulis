👀 I’m a financial and data journalist as well as a policy researcher currently taking up my master of science degree
in data journalism at Columbia University in New York.

🌱 Currently learning programming to aid my reporting, particularly Python and have this unexplainable fascination with pandas and bs4, while trying to love Selenium.

💞️ Interested on anything about the economy, politics and business-- essentially anything with data that can be analyzed and processed. Used to do boxing during free time (prior to pandemic),loves to travel, binges on video-streaming shows and a trying-hard, trying-to-fit-in and wannabe coder (hey, hopefully I succeed!)
